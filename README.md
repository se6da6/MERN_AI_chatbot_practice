# MERN_AI_chatbot_practice
With this application I try to create my own chatbot with the help of MERN stack. During this app I gained experience in 
- Creation of a robust user authentication and authorization system.
- Implementation of express-validators middleware for data validation.
- Techniques to store user chats in MongoDB securely.
- Crafting your own authentication system.
- Usage of JWT authorization tokens and HTTP only cookies.
- Ensuring user route protection with verification checks.
- Building a modern React app with Vite.
- Designing an elegant chat UI with the Material UI library.
- Assurance of a complete responsive design with a modern flair.
- Integration of OpenAI with Node and Express MERN stack app.
- Creation of a full-stack ChatGPT-like clone.
- Effective storage of user sessions.
